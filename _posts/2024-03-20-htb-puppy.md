# HackTheBox - Puppy Writeup

![Puppy Machine](/assets/puppy.webp){: .right }{: w="375" h="190" }

## Overview
Puppy is an easy-rated Linux machine on HackTheBox that focuses on web application security and privilege escalation. This machine provides an excellent opportunity to practice SQL injection and file upload vulnerabilities.

## Initial Reconnaissance
Starting with a standard Nmap scan, we discovered several open ports:
- Port 22 (SSH)
- Port 80 (HTTP)

The web application running on port 80 appeared to be a simple photo gallery application.

## Exploitation
### Web Application Analysis
The web application had a login page that was vulnerable to SQL injection. Using a simple payload:
```sql
' OR '1'='1
```
We were able to bypass the authentication and gain access to the admin panel.

### File Upload Vulnerability
The admin panel had a file upload feature that allowed us to upload a PHP reverse shell. After uploading our shell, we were able to gain initial access to the system.

## Privilege Escalation
### User to Root
After gaining initial access, we discovered a SUID binary that was vulnerable to path hijacking. By manipulating the PATH environment variable, we were able to escalate our privileges to root.

## Key Takeaways
1. Always test for SQL injection vulnerabilities in login forms
2. File upload features should be thoroughly tested for security
3. SUID binaries can be a common vector for privilege escalation
4. Environment variables should be properly sanitized

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Burp Suite
- SQLMap
- Netcat

## Learning Points
This machine reinforced the importance of:
- Proper input validation
- Secure file upload handling
- Environment variable security
- SUID binary auditing

Stay tuned for more writeups and security content! ðŸš€
